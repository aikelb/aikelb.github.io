I'm a freelance game developer at [PlayMedusa](https://www.playmedusa.com). I'm from the Canary Islands (Spain), and I have a piece of paper saying that I'm a "Computer Science Engineer".

I'm mostly interested in programming, specially anything related with videogames.
For the lasts 10 years most of my work has been related with Unity3D development, and eventually, some websites including blockchain and smartcontract development.

The Island Jam is a videogame development competition organized in Gran Canaria based on the Ludum Dare event. 

As a mentor I help the participants to develop their videogames, supporting them in the code side. In the first editions I also taught videogame development courses in Unity3D at a basic and advanced level.
